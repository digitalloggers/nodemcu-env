------------

This repository provides an integration script to build NodeMCU with
the ESP Open SDK. You need a UN*X-like system to use it. Be sure to
clone the repository recursively.

Use build.sh to build the NodeMCU firmware parts (in
nodemcu-firmware/bin/). You may flash them to a device using
flash.sh, or find a different use for them.
